I am a PhD student at DESY Zeuthen, close to Berlin. My research interests currently focus on the afterglows of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), in particular the ones originating from the collapse of a massive, rotating star at the end of its live. I really enjoy the connection between observations and theory in astrophysics!

[Our paper on GRB 221009A](https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/advance-article/doi/10.1093/mnrasl/slad185/7458668) got accepted!

Recently, I could give a short summary talk about my current work at the wonderful [HEPRO 8](https://hepro8.sciencesconf.org/) conference in Paris! [See here my slides](https://hepro8.sciencesconf.org/data/program/Klinger.pdf).

I am currently looking for Postdoc positions - please get in touch if you're interested!

Exciting: I am involved in the [publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13371) of the [AMÂ³ code](https://gitlab.desy.de/am3/am3), which is now public! If you are interested in lepto-hadronic radiation modelling - check it out!
