## Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows

### Flat energy spectra up to the highest energies - Lepto-hadronic scenarios
Motivated by the emerging observational picture that GRB afterglows with detection up to TeV energies show relatively hard spectra ($ \mathrm{d} \ln N_\gamma/\mathrm{d} \ln E_\gamma \sim -2$), we are investigating scenarios how to extend the spectrum using the radiative signatures of the protons likely to be accelerated in the relativistic shock too. Besides the leptonic scenarios like the SSC scenario and the one with the extended synchrotron-component, we also explore scenarios like the proton-synchrotron, a combination of electron and synchrotron components, and scenarios involving the hadronic cascade initiated by the proton-proton interactions in a denser environment like a molecular cloud. To study this I coupled a numerical model for the dynamics of the blast wave to the timedependent, numerical one-zone solver [AM³](https://gitlab.desy.de/am3/am3). Below you see a preliminary result for the proton-synchrotron scenario. The paper is in preparation - stay tuned!

### Counts-level fits to GRB 221009A - [arXiv:2308.13854](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13854)
By far the brightest GRB detected so far - and behind the Galactic plane. This combination leads to a challenging observational situation for our data from *Swift*-XRT and *Fermi*-LAT. For *Swift*-XRT the dust rings around the source hinder our background estimation significantly, while the background estimate with *Fermi*-LAT's background templates and the limited statistics is limiting our inference of the spectrum up to energies higher than a few GeV. Taking into account the effects, and correcting where possible, we combine the data with the one from *Swift*-BAT during two contemporaneous time windows at $T_{0,\mathrm{GBM}}+4~\mathrm{ks}$ and $T_{0,\mathrm{GBM}}+22~\mathrm{ks}$ and perform a combined fit at the counts level to a synchrotron model (see below). We find that the spectrum is described well by a power-law from $10~\mathrm{keV} - 10~\mathrm{GeV}$, with a photon spectral index of about 2.2 (similar to earlier LHAASO observations). Below $10~\mathrm{keV}$ we find a break that can be interpreted in 3 scenarios: Fast cooling, slow cooling or their transition. See the paper for more details!
